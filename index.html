	<p>Workers at the Cambria Chicago Magnificent Mile hotel were on strike again on Saturday following a failed negotiation between the hotel and its workers' union earlier this week.</p>

	<p>The citywide <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-chicago-hotel-workers-strike-0908-story.html">hotel strike</a> affecting 26 downtown Chicago hotels crawled to an end as 25 hotels settled contracts with Unite Here Local 1, a union that represents 16,000 hospitality employees. However, the Cambria's first negotiation with the union on Oct. 9 did not end with an agreement due to specific terms on workers' workload and health insurances. </p>

	<p>"We just want to get cover under the big umbrella, so we agreed to the contract that JW Marriott agreed to," said Ian Heffron, general manager at Cambria Hotel. "But they (the union) want something different from us."</p>

	<p>In a statement, B Thomas Goodwin, president of Cambria Chicago, said that they have agreed to "increase wages, year-round health and welfare eligibility."</p>

	<blockquote class="blockquote">
		We've been very clear about what to take to end the strike, and the Cambria knows exactly what it is," said Sarah Lyons, 31, research analyst in the union.
	</blockquote>

	<p>Lyon said the union fights to ensure yearlong health care for employees who are temporarily laid off during winter time.</p>

	<p>"It's very important because I have four kids," said Silvia Velazquez, 38, a housekeeper who worked at Cambria for 10 years. "I need my insurance. My family depends on me."</p>

	<p>The union also seeks other improvements such as reasonable workload for hotel workers.</p>

	<p>Don Lyden, 41, shop steward and bartender at the Cambria, said that the largest disagreement is the work conditions for housekeepers. "The deal on the table is to increase the workload for all of our housekeepers by two rooms per day, from 13 to 15."</p>

	<p>Jayne Olson, 66, a guest at Cambria said that the workers are wasting a really good opportunity. "I think the sad thing now is people tend to want things but aren't willing to work and earn it."</p>

	<p>Another guest at the hotel, Paula Chaves, 37, said the strike is "reasonable as long as the employees are fighting for their rights to get treated better."</p>

	<p>Lyden said that the strike is going to continue for as long as it takes. "We are not willing to be treated as second class citizens. We should not be expected to sign a deal thatâ€™s inferior to the rest of the city."</p>
